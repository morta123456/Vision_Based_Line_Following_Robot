## üß≠ Project Overview

This project implements a **camera-only line-following robot** that uses **OpenCV** for real-time image analysis.
The robot captures video frames, detects the path using **color thresholds and contours**, and adjusts its motion accordingly through a **motor control system**.

By leveraging only visual data, this project demonstrates how computer vision can replace traditional sensors like infrared or ultrasonic modules in simple autonomous navigation tasks.

## üéØ Project Goals

- üì∑ Use a camera as the sole sensor for path detection and tracking.

- üß† Implement color and contour-based line detection using OpenCV.

- ‚öôÔ∏è Control the robot‚Äôs motors dynamically based on the detected path position.

- üß© Develop modular and reusable Python scripts for image processing and control logic.

- üß™ Test and validate the line-following performance under different lighting and path conditions.
